Introduction:
  - Typescript is the typed superset of javascript that compiles(transpiles) to javascript

why typescript?
 - It adds type enforcement unlike javascript
 - It is much easy to maintain
 - It has cross platform support(like java) run on any browser and any operating systems

Types:
  There are diffrent types available in typescript which is almost available in JS like,
    - Number, String, Boolean, Any, void, Null

Variable Declarations:
  Declaration of variable can be done with following in Typescript
    -let, const, var

Enums
  Enums allows us to define a set of named numeric constants. An enum can be defined using the enum keyword

Functions
  - Just like anyother programming language it is a building block of code
  Function Parameters,
    - Parameters with types
    - Rest parameters
    - Default parameters

  - Anonymous function which don't have name/identifier are considered as anonymous functions. These functions are dynamic and called during runtime
  - Lambda refers to anonymous function in programming. Lambda functions are a concise mechanisam to represent anonymous functions.


Module Loaders:
  - node js manages the ts file using commonjs module which is the default one

  - tsc --m amd --target es6 app_2.ts --outFile out.js
    --m specifies the module to be used for compilation amd, es6, etc., by default node uses the commonjs
    --target specifies the module to be used to compilation
    --outFile specifies the name of the compiled js file
  - node out.js will print the output
